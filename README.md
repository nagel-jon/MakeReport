# MakeReport
Database Systems 4620 Final Project
Jonathan Nagel jn855420@ohio.edu

Goal: To Make News Reports synthesizing Online News Media  
MakeReport works by gathering News Sources Based on either Keyword Search or Date. Allowing for report generation for a specific topic of interest or a point in time. The user is then prompted to enter their instructions for report generation. This can all be done in natural language as the report generation is done by ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo. When a user creates a report, it is put into a database collection along with information about the news articles used to write it. The user can then search through reports, articles, and sources via text.

Need 3 Query Types:
1. By String Matching
2. By Date
3. By Source (Would Join Sources and Articles)
4. By Date and Source (would also join)
